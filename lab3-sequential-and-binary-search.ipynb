This means that the binary search using slice will not perform in strict logarithmic time. Luckily this can be remedied by passing the list along with the starting and ending indices.  We leave this implementation as an exercise.\n",

In fact, we should always consider whether it is cost effective to take on the extra work of sorting to gain searching benefits. If we can sort once and then search many times, the cost of the sort is not so significant. However, for large lists, sorting even once can be so expensive that simply performing a sequential search from the start may be the best choice."
